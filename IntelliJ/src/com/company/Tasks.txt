add sensor critical threshold
abstract DataLoggerClient to writing to indiscriminate output stream (mainly for file and socket I/O)
write DataLoggerClient and SensorUpdater into children of a single class (similar behavior and purpose)
    write DataLoggerClient and file logger as children of a child of aforementioned parent (recording behavior goes beyond value updates)
