Write a Java class that will read 2 data point queues and store the last X seconds of data for every sensor (consider sensor names unique for identification purposes).

The queues will have duplicates, meaning one data point will be found in both queues but not necessarily at the same time. Make sure you eliminate these duplicates.

Requirements:
	Implement Java's Runnable interface.

Suggestions:
	* consider storing each individual sensor's recent history as some sort of queue
	* consider storing each collection of recent history as a HashMap entry, using the name of the sensor as the key

Input:
	The constructor of your class should accept the 2 input queues and an int specifying how many seconds of data the queue should hold.

Output:
	* Your class should contain a method to return a COPY (!) of the sensor's history queue given a string containing that sensor's name. This copy of the sensor's history should have chronologically ordered data points.
	* Additionally, include a method that will return only the most recent data point for a given sensor.
