Write a class called TCPListener that will locate the car on the network using our automatic discovery protocol, open a client socket, and receive data from the network. There is no need for filtering. Add each data point to a queue stored by the TCPListener. It is recommend that you use the DataPoint class to convert incoming strings to usable values, but other solutions are valid as long as they're consistent across the pit software.

Input:
The constructor should accept the multicast group as a string (e.g.: "225.0.0.1") and the network port to be used as an int (e.g.: 1234)

Additional Requirements:

Implement Java's Runnable interface and use the constructor only to store the multicast group and port number

Make the following functions public:
	getOutputQueue() <- this should return the queue that is being filled with data
	end() <- this should prompt the TCPListener object to quit

The full write-up for the protocol mentioned is available in the modules folder.
