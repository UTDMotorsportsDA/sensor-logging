Pit Software Module Design Guidelines

* Please keep your code clean, indented, and readable - always consider the person trying to understand your work.
* Use Java version 1.8 for compatibility
* With completed modules, include a brief documentation with the following information
	* classes included and their methods
	* dependencies outside default Java classes (minimize these)
	* how another programmer is meant to use your module
	* limitations on what input can be provided
	* links to additional references
	* anything else someone should know about your module
* Please keep compiled files (.class and .jar) out of the Github repository
