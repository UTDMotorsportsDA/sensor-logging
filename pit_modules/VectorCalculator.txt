Following the tutorial on the github wiki, write a class called VectorCalculatorXXX, where XXX are your initials
(to avoid conflicts) that will perform basic vector operations.

Required operations:
* sum(a, b) - return the vector sum of a and b
* difference(a, b) - return a minus b
* magnitude(a) - return the magnitude of vector a

All vectors will be given as arrays of floats, and each vector must be validated to ensure its contains three values.

Each operation should be a publicly available static method inside the class.
