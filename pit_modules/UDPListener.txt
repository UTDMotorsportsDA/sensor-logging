Write a class called UDPListener that will receive data from the network and filter out only data points. Add each data
point to a queue stored by the UDPListener.

Input:
The constructor should accept the multicast group as a string (e.g.: "225.0.0.1") and the network port to be used as an
int (e.g.: 1234)

Additional Requirements:

Implement Java's Runnable interface and use the constructor only to store the multicast group and port number

Make the following functions public:
	getOutputQueue() <- this should return the queue that is being filled with data
	end() <- this should prompt the UDPListener object to quit

The full write-up for the data protocol is available in the modules folder.
